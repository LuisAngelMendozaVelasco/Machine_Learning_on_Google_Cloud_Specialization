# Training neural networks with Tensorflow 2 and the Keras Sequential API

In this module you will get introduced to writing TensorFlow models using the Keras Sequential API. But, before you jump right into writing the model, we will talk about activation functions, loss and optimization. You will then be introduced to the Keras Sequential API to learn how you can create deep learning models with it. You will also learn how to deploy the model for prediction in the cloud.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how activation functions, loss and optimizers work
- Build a DNN model using the Keras Sequential API
- Learn how to use feature columns in a Keras model
- Learn how to train a model with Keras
- Learn how to save/load, and deploy a Keras model on Google Cloud AI Platform
- Learn how to deploy and make predictions with at Keras model
