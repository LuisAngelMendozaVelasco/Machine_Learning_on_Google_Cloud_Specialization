# Introduction to course

This course is an introduction to TensorFlow 2.x, which incorporates the ease of use of Keras for building machine learning models. This course covers designing and building a TensorFlow 2.x input data pipeline, building machine learning models with TensorFlow 2.x and Keras, improving the accuracy of machine learning models, and writing machine learning models for scaled use.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the key components of TensorFlow
- Use the tf.data library to manipulate data and large datasets
- Create machine learning models in TensorFlow
- Use Keras sequential and functional APIs for model creation with Tensorflow 2.x
- Train, deploy, and productionize ML models at scale with Cloud AI Platform
