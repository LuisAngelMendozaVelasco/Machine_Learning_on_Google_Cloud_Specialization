# Feature Crosses

In traditional machine learning, feature crosses donâ€™t play much of a role, but in modern day ML methods, feature crosses are an invaluable part of your toolkit.In this module, you will learn how to recognize the kinds of problems where feature crosses are a powerful way to help machines learn.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe feature crosses.
- Discuss feature crosses to create a good classifier.
- Incorporate feature creation as part of your ML pipeline
- Perform advanced feature engineering using BQML and Keras/TensorFlow 2.x
