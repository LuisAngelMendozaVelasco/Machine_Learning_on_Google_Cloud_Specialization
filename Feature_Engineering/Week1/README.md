# Introduction to Course

Feature engineering is often the longest and most difficult phase of building your ML project. In the feature engineering process, you start with your raw data and use your own domain knowledge to create features that will make your machine learning algorithms work.

## Learning Objectives

# Raw Data to Features

Feature engineering is often the longest and most difficult phase of building your ML project. In the feature engineering process, you start with your raw data and use your own domain knowledge to create features that will make your machine learning algorithms work. In this module we explore what makes a good feature and how to represent them in your ML model.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the relationship between raw data and features.
- Identify good features.
- Describe how features can be represented.
- Perform basic feature engineering using BQML, Keras, and TensorFlow 2.x
