# TensorFlow Transform

TensorFlow Transform (tf.Transform) is a library for preprocessing data with TensorFlow. tf.Transform is useful for preprocessing that requires a full pass the data, such as: - normalizing an input value by mean and stdev - integerizing a vocabulary by looking at all input examples for values - bucketizing inputs based on the observed data distribution In this module we will explore use cases for tf.Transform.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement feature preprocessing and feature creation using tf.transform
- Carry out feature processing efficiently, at scale and on streaming data
