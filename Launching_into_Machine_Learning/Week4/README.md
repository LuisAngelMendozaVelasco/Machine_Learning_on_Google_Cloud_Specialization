# Generalization and Sampling

Now itâ€™s time to answer a rather weird question: when is the most accurate ML model not the right one to pick? As we hinted at in the last module on Optimization -- simply because a model has a loss metric of 0 for your training dataset does not mean it will perform well on new data in the real world. You will learn how to create repeatable training, evaluation, and test datasets and establish performance benchmarks.
