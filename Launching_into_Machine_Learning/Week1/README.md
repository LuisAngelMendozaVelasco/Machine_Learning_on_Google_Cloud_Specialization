# Introduction to Course

In this course youâ€™ll get foundational ML knowledge so that you understand the terminology that we use throughout the specialization. You will also learn practical tips and pitfalls from ML practitioners here at Google and walk away with the code and the knowledge to bootstrap your own ML models.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the course objectives
- Optimize and evaluate models using loss functions and performance metrics
- Mitigate common problems that arise in machine learning
- Create repeatable training, evaluation, and test datasets

## Introduction to Launching into ML

# Improve Data Quality and Exploratory Data Analysis

In this module, we will introduce data quality issues and how to improve them. We will then look at exploratory data anlaysis.

## Learning Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
- Categorize missing data strategies
