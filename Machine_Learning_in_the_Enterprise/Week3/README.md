# Embeddings

In this module, you will learn how to use embeddings to manage sparse data, to make machine learning models that use sparse data consume less memory and train faster. Embeddings are also a way to do dimensionality reduction, and in that way, make models simpler and more generalizable.

## Learning Objectives

- Use embeddings to: Manage sparse data, Reduce dimensionality, Increase model generalization, Cluster observations
- Create reusable embeddings
- Explore embeddings in TensorBoard
