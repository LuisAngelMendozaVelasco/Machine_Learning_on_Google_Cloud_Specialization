# Hyperparameter Tuning

In this module you will learn how to differentiate between parameters and hyperparameters. Then we’ll discuss traditional grid search approach and learn how to think beyond it with smarter algorithms. Finally you’ll learn how Cloud ML engine makes it so convenient to automate hyperparameter tuning.

## Learning Objectives

- Differentiate between parameters and hyperparameters
- Think beyond simple grid search algorithms
- Take advantage of Cloud ML Engine for hyperparameter tuning

# A Pinch of Science

In this module, we will start to introduce the science along with the art of machine learning. We’re first going to talk about how to perform regularization for sparsity so that we can have simpler, more concise models. Then we’re going to talk about logistic regression and learning how to determine performance.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply L1 and L2 regularization for sparsity
- Understand why regularization is important for Logistic Regression
